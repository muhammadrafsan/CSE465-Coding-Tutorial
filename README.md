# CSE465: PyTorch Coding Tutorial

Welcome to the **CSE465: PyTorch Coding Tutorial** repository! This project is designed to provide an easy-to-follow introduction to neural networks and deep learning concepts using PyTorch. You'll find resources, datasets, and Jupyter notebooks to help you understand and apply basic deep learning techniques.

## 📁 Repository Contents
  
- **`Session1_ANN.ipynb`**: A Jupyter notebook covering:
  - Data Loading (Tabular dataset)
  - Data Pre-processing
  - Implementation of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using PyTorch
  - ANN Training and Evaluation
  
**Note: The dataset link is provided at the beginning of the notebook.**

🚀 **The notebooks were executed on Google Colab using a T4 GPU.**
